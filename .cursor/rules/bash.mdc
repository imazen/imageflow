description: Rules for working on bash scripts and their tests
globs: *.sh, *.yml

# Goal: Enforce cross-platform bash script guidelines
# Reasoning:
#   1. We want all .sh scripts to work with Bash 3.2 on macOS, Git Bash on Windows, WSL2, Ubuntu 22–24. cygpath is never available.
#   2. We need to ensure each .sh script has a corresponding test_ script. test_scripts should create a unique directory to contain all their filesystem work, remove it on pass/fail, and restore the current directory and env vars to what they were before it ran.
#   3. For Windows, we assume a fresh install with only Git available; use powershell.exe if needed (no pwsh).
#   4. Powershell automatically handles slash conversions, but /c/ must become C:/. Create tests for powershell files
#   5. Use set -e and set -o pipefail for bash. Avoid silent failure. 
#   6. For both powerhshell files and bash files, use functions and DRY things as much as possible. 
#   7. Add verification checks for all inputs, whether files, dirs, or variables, and make contractual boundaries and division of responsibility clear.

      Ensure compatibility with:
      • Bash 3.2 on macOS
      • Git Bash on Windows (use powershell.exe where appropriate)
      • WSL2
      • Ubuntu 22–24
      • x64 and arm64 architectures
      Please provide a test_ script that verifies the script on each platform.
      Use set -e and set -o pipefail for bash
      For both powerhshell files and bash files, use functions and DRY things as much as possible. 
      Add verification checks for all inputs, whether files, dirs, or variables, and make contractual boundaries and division of responsibility clear.

      build.sh (no test script)
